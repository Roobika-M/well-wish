# 🌟 Crowd Wish Wall

Crowd Wish Wall is a simple, anonymous wish‑sharing web app. Anyone can post a short wish and show support for others through upvotes. New wishes and vote counts appear in real time, and the experience is intentionally login‑free to keep it lightweight, welcoming, and quick to use.

The public wall is designed to be scrollable, clean, and mobile‑first so people can read and contribute from any device with minimal friction.
